<span id="index-monitor_002c-available"></span>
<p><code>fswatch</code> is a file system monitoring utility that achieves
portability across multiple platforms by decoupling the front-end (the
<code>fswatch</code> itself) from back-end logic.  Back-end logic is
encapsulated in multiple, system-specific <em>monitors</em>, interacting
with different monitoring <acronym>API</acronym>s.  Since each operating system
may ship a different set of <acronym>API</acronym>s<a id="DOCF16" href="#FOOT16"><sup>16</sup></a>, each operating system will support the
corresponding set of monitors.
</p>
<p>The list of available monitors is decided at build time by the
<code>configure</code> script.  Monitors cannot be currently plugged-in
but recompiling the <code>libfswatch</code> library (shipped with
<code>fswath</code>).  The list of available monitors can be obtained in
the help message:
</p>

<h3 class="section">5.1 Available Monitors</h3>
<span id="index-monitors_002c-available"></span>
<p>Currently, the available monitors are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The <em>FSEvents</em> monitor, a monitor based on the File System Events
<acronym>API</acronym> of Apple macOS (see <a href="#The-FSEvents-Monitor">The FSEvents Monitor</a>).

</li><li> The <em>kqueue</em> monitor, a monitor based on <em>kqueue</em>, an event
notification interface introduced in FreeBSD 4.1 and supported on most
*BSD systems (including macOS) (see <a href="#The-kqueue-Monitor">The kqueue Monitor</a>).

</li><li> The <em>File Events Notification</em> monitor, a monitor based on the
File Events Notification <acronym>API</acronym> of the Solaris/Illumos kernel
(see <a href="#The-File-Events-Notification-Monitor">The File Events Notification Monitor</a>).

</li><li> The <em>inotify</em> monitor, a Linux kernel subsystem that reports file
system changes to applications (see <a href="#The-inotify-Monitor">The inotify Monitor</a>).

</li><li> The <em>Windows</em> monitor, a monitor that uses the Microsoft Windows&rsquo;
<code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code> function and reads change events
asynchronously.

</li><li> The <em>poll</em> monitor, a monitor that periodically stats the file
system, saves file modification times in memory and manually
calculates file system changes, which can work on any operating system
where <code>stat</code> can be used (see <a href="#The-Poll-Monitor">The Poll Monitor</a>).
</li></ul>

<p>Each monitor has its own strengths, weakness and peculiarities.
Although <code>fswatch</code> strives to provide a uniform experience no
matter which monitor is used, it is still important for users to know
which monitor they are using and to be aware of existing bugs,
limitations, corner cases or pathological behaviour.

<span id="The-FSEvents-Monitor"></span><span id="index-FSEvents-monitor"></span>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-FSEvents-1"></span>
<p>The FSEvents monitor, available only on Apple macOS, has no known
limitations and scales very well with the number of files being
observed.  In fact, I observed no performance degradation when testing
<code>fswatch</code> observing changes on a filesystem of 500
<acronym>GB</acronym> over long periods of time.  This is the default monitor
on Apple macOS.

<span id="index-monitor_002c-FSEvents_002c-peculiarities"></span>
<p>The (<samp>--recursive</samp>, <samp>-r</samp>) and (<samp>--directories</samp>,
<samp>-d</samp>) options have no effect when used with the FSEvents
monitor since the FSEvents <acronym>API</acronym> already monitors a
directory&rsquo;s children by default.  There is no overhead nor
resource-consumption issue with this behaviour, but users processing
the output must be aware that for each directory <em>multiple</em>
events may be generated by its children.

<p>If you specify this flag and more than latency seconds have elapsed
since the last event, your app will receive the event immediately.  The
delivery of the event resets the latency timer and any further events
will be delivered after latency seconds have elapsed.  This flag is
useful for apps that are interactive and want to react immediately to
changes but avoid getting swamped by notifications when changes are
occurring in rapid succession.  If you do not specify this flag, then
when an event occurs after a period of no events, the latency timer is
started.  Any events that occur during the next latency seconds will be
delivered as one group (including that first event).  The delivery of
the group of events resets the latency timer and any further events will
be delivered after latency seconds.  This is the default behavior and is
more appropriate for background, daemon or batch processing apps.

<h3 class="section">5.3 The kqueue Monitor</h3>
<span id="The-kqueue-Monitor"></span><span id="index-kqueue-monitor"></span>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-kqueue-1"></span>
<span id="index-kevent"></span>
<p>The kqueue monitor, available on any *BSD system featuring the
<code>kevent</code> function, is very similar in principle to other
similar <acronym>API</acronym>s (such as FSEvents and inotify) but has
important drawback and limitations.
</p>
<ul class="section-toc">

<div class="subsection" id="Peculiarities-1">
<h4 class="subsection">5.3.1 Peculiarities</h4>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-kqueue_002c-peculiarities"></span>
<p>The kqueue monitor <em>requires a file descriptor to be opened for
every file being watched</em>.  As a result, this monitor scales
<em>badly</em> with the number of files being observed and may begin to
misbehave as soon as the <code>fswatch</code> process runs out of file
descriptors.  In this case, <code>fswatch</code> dumps one error on
standard error for every file that cannot be opened so that users are
notified and can take action, including terminating the
<code>fswatch</code> session.  Beware that on some systems the maximum
number of file descriptors that can be opened by a process is set to a
<em>very low value</em> (values as low as 256 are not uncommon), even if
the operating system may allow a much larger value.
</p>
<p>If you are running out of file descriptors when using this monitor and
you cannot reduce the number of observed items, either:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Consider raising the number of maximum open file descriptors (check
your OS&rsquo; documentation).

</li><li> Consider using the (<samp>--directories</samp>, <samp>-d</samp>) option.

</li><li> Consider using another monitor.

<span id="The-File-Events-Notification-Monitor"></span><span id="index-File-Events-Notification-monitor"></span>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-File-Events-Notification"></span>
<p>The <em>File Events Notification</em> monitor is backed by the File
Events Notification <acronym>API</acronym> of the Solaris/Illumos kernel.  This
monitor is very efficient, it suffers from no known
resource-exhaustion problems and it scales very well with the number
of objects being watched.  This monitor is the default monitor on
systems running a Solaris or Illumos kernel providing this
<acronym>API</acronym>.

<span id="index-inotify_005frm_005fwatch"></span>
<span id="index-inotify_005fadd_005fwatch"></span>
<p>The <em>inotify</em> monitor is backed by the inotify <acronym>API</acronym> and
the <code>inotify_*</code> set of functions, introduced on Linux since
kernel 2.6.13.  Similarly to the FSEvents <acronym>API</acronym>, inotify is
very efficient, it suffers from no known resource-exhaustion problems
and it scales very well with the number of objects being watched.
This monitor is the default monitor on systems running inotify-enabled
Linux kernels.

<span id="index-queue-overflow"></span>
<p>The inotify monitor may suffer a queue overflow if events are
generated faster than they are read from the queue.  In any case, the
application is guaranteed to receive an overflow notification which
can be handled to gracefully recover.
</p>
<p>By default, the <code>fswatch</code> process is terminated after the
notification is sent by throwing an exception.  Using the
<samp>--allow-overflow</samp> option makes <code>fswatch</code> emit a change
event of type <code>Overflow</code> without exiting.
</p>

<div class="subsubsection" id="Duplicate-Events">
<h4 class="subsubsection">5.5.1.2 Duplicate Events</h4>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-inotify_002c-duplicate-events"></span>
<p>The inotify <acronym>API</acronym> sends events for the <em>direct</em> child
elements of a watched directory and it scales pretty well with the
number of watched items.  For this reason, depending on the number of
files to watch, it may sometimes be preferable to non-recursively
watch a common parent directory and filter received events rather than
adding a huge number of file watches.  If recursive watches are used,
then duplicate change events will be received:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One generated by the parent directory of the file that has changed.

</li><li> One generated by the file that has changed.
</li></ul>

<span id="The-Windows-monitor"></span><span id="index-Windows-monitor"></span>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-Windows"></span>
<p>The Windows monitor uses the Windows&rsquo; <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code>
function for each watched path and asynchronously waits for change
events using overlapped I/O.  The Windows monitor is the default
choice on Windows because it is the best performing monitor on that
platform and it is affected by virtually no limitations.

<span id="index-monitor_002c-Windows_002c-overflow"></span>
<span id="index-buffer-overflow"></span>
<p>The Windows monitor may suffer a buffer overflow if events are
generated faster than they can be stored in the buffer allocated by
the operating system when <code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code> is first called
on a watched path.  Once the buffer has been created, it is never
resized and will live until the file handle events are listened upon
is closed.
</p>
<p>Another source of overflow is the size of the buffer passed to
<code>ReadDirectoryChangesW</code> by its caller.  Unless the one created by
Windows, this buffer&rsquo;s size can be tuned by the user.  The custom
<code>windows.ReadDirectoryChangesW.buffer.size</code> property can be used
to programmatically set the size of the buffer (in bytes) when
<code>fswatch</code> is invoked, as shown in the following example where a 4
kilobytes buffer is used:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$ fswatch --monitor-property \
    windows.ReadDirectoryChangesW.buffer.size=4096 \
    ~
</pre></div>

<p>By default, the <code>fswatch</code> process is terminated after the
notification is sent by throwing an exception.  Using the
<code>--allow-overflow</code> option makes <code>fswatch</code> emit a change
event of type <code>Overflow</code> without exiting.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsubsection" id="Directory-Watching">
<h4 class="subsubsection">5.6.1.2 Directory Watching</h4>
<p>The Windows <acronym>API</acronym> lets user watch <em>directory</em>, not
<em>files</em>.  <code>fswatch</code> currently passes path arguments to the
underlying monitor as they are: as a consequence, if a path
corresponds to a file, the monitor will emit an error and will not be
able to watch it.
</p>
<p>For the same reasons, the (<samp>--directories</samp>/<samp>-d</samp>) has no
effect when using this monitor.
</p>
</div>
<div class="subsubsection" id="Recursivity">
<h4 class="subsubsection">5.6.1.3 Recursivity</h4>
<p>The Windows <acronym>API</acronym> will return change events related to a
watched directory and any children of its, at any depth.  Essentially,
the subtree rooted at a directory is <em>recursively</em> watched even
if the <code>-r</code> option is not used explicitly.

<span id="The-Poll-Monitor"></span><span id="index-Poll-monitor"></span>

<p>The poll monitor was added as a fallback mechanisms in the cases where
no other monitor could be used, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Operating system without any sort of file events <acronym>API</acronym>.

</li><li> Situations where the limitations of the available monitors cannot be

<div class="subsubsection" id="Performance-Problems">
<h4 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.1 Performance Problems</h4>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-poll_002c-performanc"></span>
<p>The resource consumption of this monitor increases increases
<em>linearly</em> with the number of files being watched (the resulting
system performance will probably degrade <em>linearly</em> or quicker).
</p>
<span id="index-stat-1"></span>
<p>The authors&rsquo; experience indicates that <code>fswatch</code> requires
approximately 150 <acronym>MB</acronym> of <acronym>RAM</acronym> memory to observe a
hierarchy of 500,000 files with a minimum path length of 32
characters.  A common bottleneck of the poll monitor is disk access,
since <code>stat()</code>-ing a great number of files may take a
<em>huge</em> amount of time.  In this case, the latency
(see <a href="Invoking-fswatch.html#Latency">Latency</a>) should be set to a sufficiently large value in order
to reduce the performance degradation that may result from frequent
disk access; this monitor, in fact, will re-scan <em>all</em> the
monitored object hierarchy looking for differences <em>every</em> time
its &lsquo;monitoring loop&rsquo; is repeated.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Note:</b> Using a disk drive with lower latencies may certainly help, although
the authors suspect that switching to an operating system with proper
file monitoring <acronym>API</acronym>s is a better solution when performance
problems with the poll monitors are experienced or when
<code>fswatch</code> should drive mission-critical processes.
</p></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="subsubsection" id="Missing-Events-and-Missing-Event-Flags">
<h4 class="subsubsection">5.7.1.2 Missing Events and Missing Event Flags</h4>
<span id="index-monitor_002c-poll_002c-missing-events"></span>
<span id="index-missing-events"></span>
<p>Since this monitor periodically checks the state of monitored objects
looking for differences, it may miss events happened between one scan
and another.  Let&rsquo;s suppose, for example, that a file <samp>file</samp>
exists at time <em class='math'>t_0</em> when a scan occurs.  The poll monitors
detects <samp>file</samp> and saves the relevant attributes in memory.
<samp>file</samp> is then updated, moved to another place and recreated with
the same name.  The chain of events<a id="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a>
occurred to <samp>file</samp> are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>Updated</code>

</li><li> <code>MovedFrom</code> (or <code>Deleted</code>)

</li><li> <code>Created</code>

</li><li> <code>Link</code>
</li></ul>

<p>At time <em class='math'>t_1</em>, another scan runs and the poll monitor detects
that the modification date has changed.  The poll monitor can only
infer that a &lsquo;change&rsquo; has occurred and raises an <code>Updated</code>
event; other events that would be noticed and raised by other
<acronym>API</acronym>s are effectively <em>lost</em> since they go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>The odds of incurring such a loss is inversely proportional to the
latency <em class='math'>l</em>: reducing the latency helps alleviating this problem,
although on the other hands it also results in linearly increasing
resource usage.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="How-to-Choose-a-Monitor">
<h3 class="section">5.8 How to Choose a Monitor</h3>
<p><code>fswatch</code> already chooses the &lsquo;best&rsquo; monitor for your platform
if you do not specify any.  However, a specific monitor may be better
suited to specific use cases.  Please, see <a href="#Monitors">Monitors</a> to get a
description of all the available monitors and their limitations.
</p>
<p>Usage recommendations are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> On Apple macOS, use only the FSEvents monitor (which is the default
behaviour).

</li><li> On Solaris/Illumos-based systems, use the File Events Notification
monitor.

</li><li> On Linux, use the inotify monitor (which is the default behaviour).

</li><li> If the number of files to observe is sufficiently small, use the
kqueue monitor.  Beware that on some systems the maximum number of
file descriptors that can be opened by a process is set to a very
<em>low</em> value (values as low as 256 are not uncommon), even if the
operating system may allow a much larger value.  In this case, check
your OS documentation to raise this limit on either a per process or a
system-wide basis.

</li><li> If feasible, watch directories instead of watching files.  Properly
crafting the receiving side of the events to deal with directories may
sensibly reduce the monitor resource consumption.

</li><li> <span id="index-stat-2"></span>
If none of the above applies, use the poll monitor.  The authors&rsquo;
experience indicates that fswatch requires approximately 150
<acronym>MB</acronym> of <acronym>RAM</acronym> memory to observe a hierarchy of 500,000
files with a minimum path length of 32 characters.  A common
